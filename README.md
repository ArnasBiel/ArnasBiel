# Hi, I'm Arnas 👋

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) at Aarhus University. Previously studied Cognitive Science and AI at Tilburg University.

I'm currently looking for a student job or entry-level role in IT security or software development in Aarhus.

## Projects

**[blind-sql-injection-demo](https://github.com/ArnasBiel/blind-sql-injection-demo)** — Python  
Time-based blind SQL injection attack built for a university Web Security course. Extracts database content bit-by-bit via timing side channels, with a second script for error-correction.

**[battleship-cpp](https://github.com/ArnasBiel/battleship-cpp)** — C++  
Console Battleship game with an AI opponent that uses a probability heatmap to decide where to shoot. The diagonal search pattern the AI produces is an emergent property of the heatmap weights rather than something explicitly programmed.
